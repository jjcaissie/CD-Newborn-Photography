      <h1>hi there!</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Candace — a lover of slow mornings, good books, and meaningful
        connections. I’m someone who finds joy in the little things and deeply
        values the beauty of everyday moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past 3.5 years, I’ve worked as a postpartum nurse — supporting
        families through some of the most meaningful (and tender) days of their
        lives. While my career has recently expanded beyond just bedside
        nursing, I found myself missing those early newborn moments. That’s what
        led me here: combining my love for babies, storytelling, and quiet
        connection through photography.
      </p>
      <p>
        Newborn photography allows me to honor this special season in a
        different way — by helping you preserve the tiny details, soft snuggles,
        and newness of life at home.
